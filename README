Barlesque
=========

DESCRIPTION
===========

Barlesque is an extension for Mozilla Firefox 4.x that reclaims useful window
space by collapsing the wide grey addon bar into a neat set of addon buttons.

USAGE
=====

Barlesque doesn't require any user intervention, except that user needs to
switch the addon bar on ("View" menu -> "Toolbars" -> check the "Add-on Bar")
to see the effect.

User can change the side of screen the addon buttons are bound to through the
Options dialog (Tools menu, Addons item, "Options" button of "Barlesque").

PACKAGING
=========

The .xpi file can be created manually by using the 'zip' command (or any other
zipping software). The resulting .xpi file should contain the following files:

chrome/content/options.xul
chrome/content/overlay.js
chrome/content/overlay.xul
chrome/locale/en-US/barlesque.dtd
chrome/skin/overlay.css
defaults/preferences/barlesque.js
install.rdf
chrome.manifest

Under linux, the following instruction builds the .xpi file:

$ zip -r barlesque.xpi install.rdf chrome.manifest chrome defaults

INSTALLATION
============

The extension can be installed by drag-and-dropping the 'barlesque.xpi' file
over an existing Firefox window, or by pointing Firefox (through File menu,
"Open File..." item) to the local URL where the file is stored.
