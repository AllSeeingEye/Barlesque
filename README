Barlesque
=========

DESCRIPTION
===========

Barlesque is an extension for Mozilla Firefox 4.x that reclaims useful window
space by collapsing the wide grey addon bar into a neat set of addon buttons.

Extension implements this proposal:

USAGE
=====

Barlesque expects user to have the add-on bar switched on ("View" menu ->
"Toolbars" -> check the "Add-on Bar").

You'll see the effect of extension immediatelly after installation; add-on
bar won't be the solid horizontal band at the bottom, but will cover only
a portion of the space instead. Also, you can quickly hide the add-on bar
by clicking on the dark-grey down arrow icon at the left (if add-on bar is
bound to the right edge of screen) or right (left edge of screen) side of
addon bar. Later you can expand the add-on bar with the same icon (it will
show up-facing arrow).

By default, extension doesn't persist the collapsed/expanded state of add-on
bar between browser sessions; you can change this through the options dialog
("Tools" menu -> "Addons" item -> "Options" button of "Barlesque") by checking
the "Remember the collapsed/expanded state of the add-on bar" checkbox.

You can also change the side of screen the addon buttons are bound to through
the same options dialog by selecting the "Bottom-left" or "Bottom-right"
checkboxes.

PACKAGING
=========

The .xpi file can be created manually by using the 'zip' command (or any other
zipping software). The resulting .xpi file should contain the following files:

chrome/content/options.xul
chrome/content/overlay.js
chrome/content/overlay.xul
chrome/locale/en-US/barlesque.dtd
chrome/skin/overlay.css
chrome/skin/arrow-down.png
chrome/skin/arrow-up.png
chrome/skin/barlesque.png
defaults/preferences/barlesque.js
chrome.manifest
install.rdf

Under linux, the following instruction builds the .xpi file:

$ zip -r barlesque.xpi install.rdf chrome.manifest chrome defaults

INSTALLATION
============

The extension can be installed by drag-and-dropping the 'barlesque.xpi' file
over an existing Firefox window, or by pointing Firefox (through File menu,
"Open File..." item) to the local URL where the file is stored.
